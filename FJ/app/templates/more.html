                        Welcome to The Squad Journal, where we want you to share your day with your squad! The creators of The
                        Squad Journal wanted to mix two key ideas: journaling and being in groups. We're big on the idea of how
                        consistently carrying out small actions can lead to long term success, such as journaling. Journaling
                        comes with benefits such as a boost in oneâ€™s mood, clarity of mind and the ability to track progress. 
                        <br><br>
                        We really believe in the idea of journaling in a group as when used correctly, it's a powerful tool.
                        Every member of a group can see each others journal entries which were posted in that specific group.
                        This allows for sharing your day with those who you desire.
                        <br><br>
                        Other uses of Squad Journal include tracking progression of projects, keeping up to date with
                        friends/family, sharing ideas and keeping track of fixtures/results for sports tournements etc.
                        We have a friendly interface and an even friendlier customer support team!

                        Once you are logged in, creating a group is very easy. Go to the <a href="/creategroup">create group</a>
                        page, give the group a unique name and a password of at least 8 characters. The creator of the group will
                        automatically be joined to the group. It is recommended that you note down the name and password in case
                        you forget. Once you have created the group, you can share the name and password with those who you wish
                        to join the group.
                        <br><br>
                        To join a group, you must go onto the <a href="/joingroup">join group</a> page and enter the correct group
                        name and password, which should have been given to you by an existing member of the group.
                        <br><br>
                        To add an entry, you must go onto the <a href="/addingentry">adding entry</a> page. The first text box is
                        for your actual journal entry. What text/notes/memories will you be saving and sharing with your group?
                        The next field asks for location information (soon there will be an option to auto-fill this field). After
                        that you must confirm the group you wish to add the information to by confirming the name and password.
